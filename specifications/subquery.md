# Subquery

The SubQuery Network indexes and services data to the global community in an incentivised and verifiable way.

## Consumers

A Consumer is a participant in the SubQuery network and is either an individual or organisation that pays for processed and organised blockchain data from the SubQuery Network. Consumers effectively make requests to the SubQuery Network for specific data and pay an agreed amount of SQT in return.

Consumers are typically dApp (decentralised application) developers, data analytic companies, blockchain networks, middleware developers, or even web aggregating companies that need access to blockchain data to provide services to their end-users.

The cost of querying data on the blockchain will be based on supply and demand and will be comparable to other similar services currently available. The advantage of an open and transparent network and ecosystem is that competition is encouraged to provide the best service to the Consumer.

## Indexers

An Indexer is a SubQuery network participant who is responsible for indexing blockchain data and providing this data to their customers.

In order to earn rewards from query revenue as an Indexer it is proposed that Indexers must stake SQT against a particular SubQuery Project that they are providing the service to. The Cobb-Douglas production function will be used to determine the rewards distributed to each Indexer.

If an Indexer is caught misbehaving (such as by providing invalid, incomplete, or incorrect data), they are liable to have a portion of their staked SQT (on the particular reward pool ip) reallocated to the SubQuery Foundation Treasury, diminishing their holdings of staked SQT in the network and therefore their potential reward. Since the indexer’s allocated stake is determined by a percentage of their total SQT, this will have a flow on effect to all other reward pools that the indexer is party to.

Indexers are rewarded in SQT in two ways:

- Rewards from SQT reward pools based on distribution defined by the Cobb-Douglas Production Function.
- Direct SQT query fee rewards from Closed Agreements that an indexer is party to.

Indexers can increase their earning potential by attracting Delegators. Delegators are SQT token holders who can delegate their tokens to Indexers for additional rewards. Indexers use these additional tokens to increase the amount they allocate to projects of their choice. This allows Indexers to increase their earnings.

## Delegators

A Delegator is a non-technical network role in the SubQuery Network and is a great way to start participating in the SubQuery Network. This role enables Delegators to “delegate” their SQT to one or more Indexers and earn rewards (similar to staking).

Without Delegators, Indexers will likely earn fewer rewards because they will have less SQT to allocate. Therefore, Indexers compete to attract Delegators by offering a competitive share of an Indexer’s rewards.
